  <h1>How to Use Git, Github, and Webstorm</h1>
  <h2>What are Git, Github, and Webstorm?</h2>
  <p>All three of these entities address the processes of coding computer programs.<p>
  <h3>Git</h3>
  <p>Git is a distributed version control system - it records the changes made to a computer program, allowing the user to see the differences between each change (diffing), create separate changes to the same code (branching), and bring those separate changes together into one (merging). The user would use Git to track changes in programs that were written in an editor or an IDE (a software suite that provides basic tools required to write and run code). Git integrates with some popular IDEs to facilitate this.<p>
  <h3>Github</h3>
  <p>Github is a website that hosts and uses Git, allowing users to collaborate on open source projects (where the public can see the code), or closed source projects (where the public cannot see the code, but select users can). 
  <h3>Webstorm<h3>
  <p>Webstorm is an IDE that provides coding assistance for JavaScript, HTML and CSS and a wide range of modern web technologies. Webstorm can be integrated with Git.<p>
